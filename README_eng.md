# Hello, my name is Franck Dufournet ðŸ‘‹

## About me
I am a passionate web developer with excellent web integration skills, particularly in HTML, CSS, and SASS, along with a good understanding of SEO and Responsive design (Mobile first or not).
I gained these skills through training on OpenClassroom and FromScratch. I love learning new technologies and constantly improving my skills.
